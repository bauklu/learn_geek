Analyzing an EMAIL Archive from gmane and vizualizing the data
using the D3 JavaScript library
This is a set of tools that allow you to pull down an archive
of a komane repository using the instructions at: http://ghrne.org/export.php
In order not to overwhelm the komane.org server, I have put up
my own copy of the messages at: http://blabla.net/
This server will be faster and take a lot of load off the nbla.org server.
You should install the SQLite browser to view and modify the databases from: http://fgtd.org/
The first step is to spider the komane repository.  The base URL is hard-coded in the gfde.py and is hard-coded to the Bvsa
developer list.  You can spider another repository by changing that
base url. Make sure to delete the content.sqlite file if you
switch the base url. It stores all of its data in a database and can be interrupted and re-started
as often as needed.   
It may take many hours to pull all the data down.
So you may need to restart several times.
To give you a head-start, I have put up 600MB of pre-spidered Gffdt email here:
https://www.blabla.zip.
One nice thing is that once you have spidered all of the messages and have them in
content.sqlite, you can run komane.py again to get new messages as they get sent to the
list.
